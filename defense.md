# Defense Strategies: EXIF Metadata Malware Injection

This document outlines practical defense techniques for developers, sysadmins, and security teams to detect and mitigate the risk of malicious payloads embedded in image metadata, such as EXIF-based PHP dropper injections.

## 1. File Upload Security

### Do:
- Enforce strict MIME type validation via magic bytes (not file extensions)
- Restrict uploads to known-safe formats (e.g., JPG, PNG, PDF)
- Store uploaded files outside the web root
- Use unique, random filenames for uploads to prevent URL prediction

### Donâ€™t:
- Allow arbitrary file extensions or mixed content types
- Execute or parse any uploaded file content or metadata on the server
- Use `eval()` or `include()` on anything derived from user-uploaded files

---

## 2. EXIF Metadata Sanitization

Before storing or handling images:

### Strip Metadata:
Use tools like `exiftool` or `exiv2` to strip all metadata from user uploads.
```bash
exiftool -all= uploaded_image.png
```

Or automatically apply this server-side:
```php
// Strip EXIF using PHP GD
$image = imagecreatefromjpeg($upload_path);
imagejpeg($image, $output_path, 100);
imagedestroy($image);
```

## 3. Malware Detection & Forensics

### Detection Techniques:
- Use `exiftool` to extract and inspect fields:
```bash
exiftool suspect.png | grep -i comment
```

- Scan for suspicious keywords:
```bash
strings suspect.png | grep -Ei '(base64_|eval|curl|bash|system\(|exec\()'
```

### Tools:
- YARA rules to match common encoded backdoors
- ClamAV + metadata heuristics
- Endpoint monitoring for unexpected `/tmp/.m` executions or reverse shell activity

---

## 4. Runtime Prevention

### Server Hardening:
- Disable PHP functions like `eval`, `system`, `exec`, `shell_exec`, `passthru`, and `popen` if not needed:
```ini
; php.ini
disable_functions = eval,system,exec,shell_exec,passthru,popen
```

- Run web services under restricted users with minimal access
- Monitor `/etc/systemd/system/` for unauthorized `.service` files

---

## 5. Developer Best Practices

- Never trust headers or metadata from uploaded files
- Avoid using EXIF metadata for business logic
- Log file uploads and include hashes for traceability
- Use content scanners and validators for media (e.g., Google Safe Browsing API, ExifCleaner)

---

## 6. Blue Team Incident Response

If image-based malware injection is suspected:
- Pull a forensic copy of the uploaded image
- Run `exiftool`, `binwalk`, and `strings` analysis
- Check PHP error logs and access logs for `eval()` or shell activity
- Monitor `/tmp/`, `/var/tmp/`, and `~/.cache` for unauthorized scripts

---

## Summary

EXIF-based payload injection is stealthy but preventable with proper validation, metadata stripping, and least-privilege design. Use layered defenses to stop metadata from becoming a malware vector.
